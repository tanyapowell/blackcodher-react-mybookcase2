She just can\'t cut a break. Well, apart from one from her long term boyfriend, Tom. That\'s just a break though. Definitely not a break up. Stuck between a boss who doesn\'t seem to see her, a family who don\'t seem to listen (if it\'s not Jesus or water rates, they\'re not interested), and trying to fit in two worlds that don\'t really understand her, it\'s no wonder she\'s struggling. She was named to be queen of everything. So why is she finding it so hard to rule her own life? A darkly comic and bitingly subversive take on life, love, race and family, Queenie will have you nodding in recognition, crying in solidarity and rooting for this unforgettable character every step of the way.

This is the story of a family -- of the simple, devastating ways in which families tear themselves apart, and of the incredible lengths to which a family will go to put itself back together. It is the story of one family, the Sais, whose good life crumbles in an evening; a Ghanaian father, Kweku Sai, who becomes a highly respected surgeon in the US only to be disillusioned by a grotesque injustice; his Nigerian wife, Fola, the beautiful homemaker abandoned in his wake; their eldest son, Olu, determined to reconstruct the life his father should have had; their twins, seductive Taiwo and acclaimed artist Kehinde, both brilliant but scarred and flailing; their youngest, Sadie, jealously in love with her celebrity best friend. All of them sent reeling on their disparate paths into the world. Until, one day, tragedy spins the Sais in a new direction. This is the story of a family: torn apart by lies, reunited by grief. A family absolved, ultimately, by that bitter but most tenuous bond: familial love. Ghana Must Go interweaves the stories of the Sais in a rich and moving drama of separation and reunion, spanning generations and cultures from West Africa to New England, London, New York and back again. It is a debut novel of blazing originality and startling power by a writer of extraordinary gifts. \'Ghana Must Go is both a fast moving story of one family\'s fortunes and an ecstatic exploration of the inner lives of its members. With her perfectly-pitched prose and flawless technique, Selasi does more than merely renew our sense of the African novel: she renews our sense of the novel, period. An astonishing debut\' Teju Cole, author of Open City Taiye Selasi was born in London and raised in Massachusetts. She holds a B.A. in American Studies from Yale and an M.Phil. in International Relations from Oxford. \\"The Sex Lives of African Girls\\" (Granta, 2011), Selasi\'s fiction debut, appears in Best American Short Stories 2012.

I wish Toni [Morrison] was alive to actually read this book. She would be so proud\' - Oprah Hiram Walker is born into bondage on a Virginia plantation. But he is also born gifted with a mysterious power that he won\'t discover until he is almost a man, when he risks everything for a chance to escape. One fateful decision will carry him away from his makeshift plantation family - his adoptive mother, Thena, a woman of few words and many secrets, and his beloved, angry Sophia - and into the covert heart of the underground war on slavery. Hidden amidst the corrupt grandeur of white plantation society, exiled as guerrilla cells in the wilderness, buried in the coffin of the deep South and agitating for utopian ideals in the North, there exists a widespread network of secret agents working to liberate the enslaved. Hiram joins their ranks and learns fast but in his heart he yearns to return to his own still-enslaved family, to topple the plantation that was his first home. But to do so, he must first master his unique power and reclaim the story of his greatest loss. Propulsive, transcendent and blazing with truth, The Water Dancer is a story of oppression and resistance, separation and homecoming. Ta-Nehisi Coates imagines the covert war of an enslaved people in response to a generations-long human atrocity - a war for the right to life, to kin, to freedom. \'One of the best books I have ever read in my entire life.

With these pieces on politics, photography, travel, history and literature - many of which have become viral sensations, shared and debated around the globe - Teju Cole solidifies his place as one of today\'s most powerful and original voices. On page after page, deploying prose dense with beauty and ideas, he finds fresh and potent ways to interpret art, people and historical moments. Cole tells of his engagement with Virginia Woolf through her diaries, before reflecting on an episode of temporary blindness in New York. He looks at the rise of Instagram and interrogates the value of its images. He examines the transition of the candidate Obama, the avid reader, into a \'forever-war\' president on the global stage. Persuasive and provocative, erudite yet accessible, Known and Strange Things is an opportunity to live within Teju Cole\'s wide-ranging enthusiasms, curiosities and passions, and a chance to see the world in surprising and affecting new frames. \'A book written with a scalpel, a microscope, and walking shoes, full of telling details and sometimes big surprises.\' Rebecca Solnit","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780571328079"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0571328075"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":304,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Collections"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":4,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.1.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Known+and+Strange+Things&hl=&as_brr=6&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":5.03,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tiSPDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":5030000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Known_and_Strange_Things-sample-epub.acsm?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Known_and_Strange_Things-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tiSPDAAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=6&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Persuasive and provocative, erudite yet accessible, Known and Strange Things is an opportunity to live within Teju Cole&#39;s wide-ranging enthusiasms, curiosities and passions, and a chance to see the world in surprising and affecting new ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"OqJaDwAAQBAJ","etag":"R0HARHqOaFM","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OqJaDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Black Is the Body","subtitle":"Stories from My Grandmother\'s Time, My Mother\'s Time, and Mine","authors":["Emily Bernard"],"publisher":"Knopf","publishedDate":"2019-01-29","description":"An extraordinary, exquisitely written memoir (of sorts) that looks at race--in a fearless, penetrating, honest, true way--in twelve telltale, connected, deeply personal essays that explore, up-close, the complexities and paradoxes, the haunting memories and ambushing realities of growing up black in the South with a family name inherited from a white man, of getting a PhD from Yale, of marrying a white man from the North, of adopting two babies from Ethiopia, of teaching at a white college and living in America\'s New England today.

Black is the body of the stories I tell.\\" And the storytelling, and the mystery of Bernard\'s storytelling, of getting to the truth, begins with a stabbing in a New England college town. Bernard writes how, when she was a graduate student at Yale, she walked into a coffee shop and, along with six other people, was randomly attacked by a stranger with a knife (\\"I remember making the decision not to let the oddness of this stranger bother me\\"). \\"I was not stabbed because I was black,\\" she writes (the attacker was white), \\"but I have always viewed the violence I survived as a metaphor for the violent encounter that has generally characterized American race relations. There was no connection between us, yet we were suddenly and irreparably bound by a knife, an attachment that cost us both: him, his freedom; me, my wholeness.\\" Bernard explores how that bizarre act of violence set her free and unleashed the storyteller in her (\\"The equation of writing and regeneration is fundamental to black American experience\\"). She writes in Black Is the Body how each of the essays goes beyond a narrative of black innocence and white guilt, how each is anchored in a mystery, and how each sets out to discover a new way of telling the truth as the author has lived it. \\"Blackness is an art, not a science.

A dangerous, hallucinatory, ancient Africa, which becomes a fantasy world as well-realized as anything Tolkien made, with language as powerful as Angela Carter\'s. I cannot wait for the next installment\' Neil Gaiman In this stunning follow-up to his Man Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, Marlon James draws on a rich tradition of African mythology, fantasy and history to imagine an ancient world, a lost child, an extraordinary hunter, and a mystery with many answers... \'The child is dead. There is nothing left to know.\' Tracker is a hunter, known throughout the thirteen kingdoms as one who has a nose - and he always works alone. But he breaks his own rule when, hired to find a lost child, he finds himself part of a group of hunters all searching for the same boy. Each of these companions is stranger and more dangerous than the last, from a giant to a witch to a shape-shifting Leopard, and each has secrets of their own. As the mismatched gang follow the boy\'s scent from perfumed citadels to infested rivers to the enchanted darklands and beyond, set upon at every turn by creatures intent on destroying them, Tracker starts to wonder: who really is this mysterious boy? Why do so many people want to stop him being found? And, most important of all, who is telling the truth and who is lying?

In this riveting and timely memoir, the groundbreaking editor unpacks lessons on race, identity, and success through her own journey, from navigating her way as the unstoppable child of a unlikely interracial marriage in small-town California to finding herself on the frontlines of a modern movement for the next generation of change makers. Welteroth moves beyond the headlines and highlight reels to share the profound lessons and struggles of being a barrier-breaker across so many intersections. As a young boss and the only black woman in the room, she\'s had enough of the world telling her \u2013 and all women \u2013 they\'re not enough. As she learns to rely on herself by looking both inward and upward, we\'re ultimately reminded that we\'re more than enough.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781473572966"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1473572967"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=more+than+enough&hl=&as_brr=6&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-vE6MDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/More_Than_Enough-sample-epub.acsm?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vE6MDwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=6&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Elaine Welteroth has climbed the ranks of media and fashion, shattering ceilings along the way."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"GNjBDwAAQBAJ","etag":"Wk4USt+iIpQ","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GNjBDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"How Beautiful We Were","authors":["Imbolo Mbue"],"publisher":"Canongate Books","publishedDate":"2021-03-11","description":"\'A formidable storyteller\' JONATHAN FRANZEN Set in the fictional African village of Kosawa, How Beautiful We Were tells the story of a people living in fear amidst environmental degradation wrought by an American oil company.

Here, you will bear witness to a perpetual salvation song.\' - Jason Reynolds Remember that moment when you first encountered a character who seemed to be written just for you? That feeling of belonging remains with readers the rest of their lives - but not everyone regularly sees themselves reflected on the pages of a book. In this timely anthology, Glory Edim, founder of the online community, Well-Read Black Girl, brings together original essays by some of America\'s best black women writers to shine a light on how important it is that we all - regardless of gender, race, religion, or ability - have the opportunity to find ourselves in literature. Whether it\'s learning about the complexities of femalehood from Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison, finding a new type of love in The Color Purple, or using mythology to craft an alternative black future, each essay reminds us why we turn to books in times of both struggle and relaxation. As she has done with her book club-turned-online community, Edim has created a space where black women\'s writing, knowledge and life experiences are lifted up, to be shared with all readers who value the power of a story to help us understand the world, and ourselves. Contributors include: Jesmyn Ward, Lynn Nottage, Jacqueline Woodson, Gabourey Sidibe, Morgan Jerkins, Tayari Jones, Rebecca Walker, and Barbara Smith. \'Essential reading for the twenty-first-century reader.
